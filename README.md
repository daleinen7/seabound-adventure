Note: this project is a work-in-progress

## Story
What once was a quiet archipelago, now is fraught with danger. Below the water, the sea life has turned agressive and violent. Above the water pirates patrol the area.

As captain Shaw the player must find safe harbor. Choose a first mate and reach the mainland.
